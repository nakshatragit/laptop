#**Vector Dot Product Implementation**

## **Introduction**
The definition of dot product can be given in two ways, i.e. algebraically and geometrically. Algebraically, the dot product is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.
- a.b=|a||b| cosÎ¸

## **Mathematical Expression**  
The dot product of two vectors _A_  and _B_, each of size $\ n \$, is calculated as:
$$\[
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i = A_1 B_1 + A_2 B_2 + \cdots + A_n B_n
\]$$

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    if len(vector_a) != len(vector_b):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

# Example usage
vec_a = [1, 2, 3]
vec_b = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vec_a, vec_b)
print("Dot product:", result)
```
